## Introduction

Use loops to draw a race track and create a racing turtle game.

### What you will make

This project introduces for loops through a fun turtle race game. Loops are used to draw the race track and to make the turtles move a random number of steps each turn. If you have a group of people to play the game, each person pick a turtle and the one that gets the furthest is the winner.
