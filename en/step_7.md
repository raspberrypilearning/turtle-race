## Challenge: Do a twirl

Can you use a `for turn in range():` loop to make each turtle do a 360 degree twirl after they get to the starting line? You'll need to make sure they are facing in the right direction at the start of the race!

`ada.right(36)` will turn the red turtle right by 36 degrees. 

**Hint:** A full turn is 360 degrees. A turtle could turn right 10 degrees 36 times, or left 5 degrees 72 times, or any other numbers make 360!
