## Introduction

In this project you will use loops to create a racing turtle game and draw a race track.

## Introduction:

This project introduces for loops through a fun turtle race game. Loops are used to draw the race track and to make the turtles move a random number of steps each turn. A group of children can each pick a turtle, the one that gets the furthest is the winner.

## Online Resources

**This project uses Python 3.** We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

* ['Turtle Race' starting point -- jumpto.cc/python-new](http://jumpto.cc/python-new)

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

* [‘Turtle Race’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/9339862606](https://trinket.io/python/9339862606)

## Offline Resources

This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

* turtle-race/turtle-race.py

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

* turtle-race-finished/turtle-race.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives

* For loops;
* Random;
* Python turtle graphics

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

* [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges

* More lines - changing the number of times a loop repeats;
* Race times - adding more turtles, includes adding code inside a loop;
* Do a twirl - make turtles spin round at the start by writing new for loops;
* Dashed lines - change solid lines into dashed lines, requires a nested loop.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* Children may need reminding about the colon `:` at the end of a `for`, it's easy to omit. 
* Incorrect indentation is a common problem when writing loops.
* Children may need reminding that there shouldn't be a space in the code `forward(100)`.
* Children should make sure that they write 'color' and 'center' using the American spelling.
